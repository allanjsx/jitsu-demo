# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run

```bash
npm install

REACT_APP_JITSU_HOST="[HOST]" REACT_APP_JITSU_WRITE_KEY="[KEY]" npm run start
```

It will automatically open a browser tab. The code that triggers the track event
is in /src/app.js. 

You can open the Chrome inspect network tab to see the call 
is hitting CORS error.
